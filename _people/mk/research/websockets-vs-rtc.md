Yes, your instinct is spot on—and it aligns with best practices for **experimental, media-rich, locally run apps** like yours. Here's how to think about it in your studio context:

---

## ✅ **When to Use WebRTC (for Real-Time UX)**

Use WebRTC when **latency, immersion, and direct media interaction** are the priority:

* 🎤 **Voice-first interactions** with users (e.g. AI teleprompter, interactive lecture assistant)
* 🎧 **Natural back-and-forth conversation flow** where users speak and hear replies, especially in-browser
* 🎭 **Performance-driven interfaces** — you’re augmenting or puppeteering live feedback loops
* 🎨 **Creative front-end experiments** where the model should feel *present* and embodied

WebRTC is essentially your actor on stage—low-latency, responsive, alive.

## ✅ **When to Use WebSockets (for Infrastructure & Control)**

Use WebSockets when **you’re orchestrating**, not performing:

* 🧠 **Backend control systems** — media automation, Slackbot agents, routing audio/video streams
* 🎬 **Server-side rendering or video remix pipelines**, where the model is parsing/transcribing/labeling files
* 🗃️ **Accessing local files** (e.g. ffmpeg, Blender, Whisper transcription) that only your machine knows about
* 🧪 **Experiments and observability** — easier to log, replay, manipulate raw event streams

WebSockets give you **maximum transparency and control**, perfect for your in-studio infrastructure and experimentation needs.

## 🔁 **Hybrid Architecture? Yes.**

You’re ideally positioned to **use both protocols** in a complementary setup:

### 🌐 WebRTC on the Frontend

* Browser handles mic/audio, UI, low-latency speech to model.
* Powered by ephemeral keys.

### 🖥 WebSocket on the Backend

* Local Node/Python server handles:

  * video file I/O
  * data transforms
  * transcription refinement
  * Slackbot integration
  * media playback control

You can even **pass events between the two**, for example:

* WebRTC session → “Hey server, here’s the user’s last sentence.”
* WebSocket server → “Cool, I just synced a highlight video for that moment.”

| Scenario                                           | Protocol               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Local voice chatbot in browser                     | **WebRTC**             |
| Slackbot controlling camera switch based on speech | **WebSocket**          |
| Local media orchestration / Blender + FFmpeg       | **WebSocket**          |
| In-browser transcription teaching tool             | **WebRTC**             |
| System that processes + logs all events deeply     | **WebSocket**          |
| AI reacts live to classroom speech                 | **WebRTC** + WebSocket |

Want help scaffolding a hybrid setup (e.g. FastAPI server with WebSocket that hands tokens to a WebRTC browser client)? I can provide a project starter.
