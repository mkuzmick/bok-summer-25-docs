## blue
* for everything blue is learning
    * blue should make a resource doc for people to learn after
    * and try to explain/teach to others after
* blue as a *tourist* in code this summer

### tools

- davinci resolve
- airtable
    - media logging base that logs all files
    - well maintained airtable to help production process 
        - title card generation
        - sequence generation
        - daily callsheets
    - printing out of airtable workflow
    - inventory of videos we have
    - space base and organizing stuff
        - poster or something of materials to find
        - searchable airtable
        - and continuing to iterate on workflow of saving material
- media production/capture workflow (system and documentation)
- switcher and system
    - run a big ethernet snake out to diff locations and start nudging ourselves to mainly using studio cams
    - develop resources on the system for others
    - expert on cameras and settings
        - camera positions and confidence monitor positions (thinking about the studio as a set)
            - figuring out what's locked down and reliable (like 3 projectors) and what's customizable/free for experimenting
- tools that students use often that we help them with, like
    - garageband
    - logic
    - after effects
    - photoshop
    - unity/unreal
- social media


### mk idea for beginner airtable project for blue
* tools airtable (could link to courses, resources, what blue is excited to learn)
    * to connect to reporting: list of every single tool we used supporting courses this year

## general notes/sprint week things
* think about key mechanics of the studio for next year and think how we can communicate it to others, like fellows who are not here all the time but want to run a workshop here
* basic training/key things everyone should know in media stuff+equipment (ll basics)

things to do in summer
* building a desk for the front
