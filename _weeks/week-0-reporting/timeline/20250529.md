# Thursday May 29

## Basic Summary of the Day

Thursday featured extensive preparation for the upcoming Week 1, with team members focusing on documentation, resource organization, and skill development. User U7NPMMT6Z created a comprehensive Airtable base for organizing training materials using a theater/film industry metaphor, while User UC7GJQLEP worked on organizing Google Drive and HackMD documents to structure summer project information. Technical skill development continued with User U04PRP4KK6C sharing DaVinci Resolve tutorials and working on multicam editing skills, and User U1VSBE6CF celebrating their first JavaScript object. The day demonstrated a transition from Week 0's initial setup to more structured planning and organization for Week 1's focus on scripts and training.

## And Now All the Details
