# Thursday May 22

## Basic Summary of the Day

The fourth day of the project was characterized by practical application of the tools and workflows developed earlier in the week. Multiple team members successfully implemented the stills extraction workflow, sharing numerous images with the proper naming conventions. User U02KRAN4ZDL created a prototype for handling Airtable projects and images, while User U06G8F7F5FX worked on site prototypes. The team also engaged with external learning resources, with User U0HTZUUP4 sharing a "Code with Claude" livestream and creating task documentation. Overall, the day demonstrated the team putting their technical infrastructure to practical use while continuing to develop their skills with tools like Davinci Resolve's multicam feature.

## And Now All the Details

### Stills Workflow Implementation

- User U06G8F5JV9T successfully implemented the stills workflow:
  - Set up the workflow on the "orange mac" workstation
  - Shared 10 extracted stills with proper naming conventions
  - Specifically thanked User U0HTZUUP4 for the script that preserves timecode and allows multiple versions
  - Tagged User U1VSBE6CF to review the results

- User U02655ZC50U demonstrated the versioning capabilities:
  - Shared 6 still images including multiple versions of the same frame
  - Showed progression of versions (v1 through v4) of the same timecode (16255112)

- User U0HTZUUP4 shared additional still image examples:
  - Posted version 3 of a still from May 21 (ll_still_20250521_16255112_v3.jpg)

### Prototype Development

- User U02KRAN4ZDL created a project card prototype:
  - Designed for handling Airtable projects and images
  - Created as a frontend prototype with Claude's assistance
  - Shared a screen recording demonstration of the functionality

- User U06G8F7F5FX worked on site prototypes:
  - Saved a working version of their prototype site
  - Created an updated version specifically for User U7NPMMT6Z

### Skill Development and Documentation

- User U02KRAN4ZDL announced mastering Davinci Resolve's multicam feature:
  - "BOOM i now know multicam in Resolve"
  - Shared a screenshot demonstrating the multicam interface

- User U0HTZUUP4 created and shared resources:
  - Shared a link to a "Code with Claude" YouTube livestream
  - Created a task document for themselves in HackMD
  - Mentioned "logging all things done on 20250422" (likely meant 20250522)

### Team Collaboration

- New member User U07F2C24ZFB joined the channel
- User U7NPMMT6Z shared an image (content unspecified)
- User U0HTZUUP4 mentioned watching the Claude livestream while working on Airtable content as backup

The day showed significant progress in practical implementation of the workflows designed earlier in the week, with team members successfully using the tools and sharing their results while continuing to develop new prototypes and skills.
