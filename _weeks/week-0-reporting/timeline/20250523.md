# Friday May 23

## Basic Summary of the Day

The fifth day of the project showed significant progress in knowledge sharing and skill development, particularly around the Resolve2Stills workflow. Users UC7GJQLEP and U06GEK8FQ2Y collaborated on learning and documenting the workflow, creating a comprehensive step-by-step guide in HackMD and sharing multiple successfully processed stills. User U04Q49VR7UH reported completing a functional Slack bot for audio transcription with Airtable integration, while User U02KRAN4ZDL demonstrated a Next.js site pulling data from Airtable. The day also saw infrastructure improvements with the addition of the "bok-summer-25-report-bots" integration to the channel, setting the stage for next week's bot development work.

## And Now All the Details

### Resolve2Stills Workflow Documentation and Training

- User U06GEK8FQ2Y and UC7GJQLEP conducted a "Resolve2Stills learn/work time":
  - Created and shared a comprehensive documentation site: [stills-workflow-summer-25](https://hackmd.io/opBFxLZSSta2G5N2pBwUPQ)
  - Documented step-by-step instructions for future users to learn the workflow
  - User U06GEK8FQ2Y shared 10 successfully processed stills with proper naming conventions, including a version 2 of one image

- User UC7GJQLEP expressed appreciation for the training:
  - Thanked User U7NPMMT6Z for teaching the workflow
  - Noted it was their first experience with Resolve, providing a good introductory project
  - Mentioned installing Resolve on their laptop for continued learning
  - Practiced advanced editing techniques with S curves (contrasting with their usual Lightroom experience)
  - Also installed Windsurf for troubleshooting purposes

- User UC7GJQLEP created a custom GPT:
  - Uploaded the Davinci Resolve manual to a GPT knowledge base
  - Reported it successfully answered technical questions about Resolve

### Bot Development and Integration

- User U04Q49VR7UH completed a functional Slack bot for audio transcription:
  - Bot processes audio files posted to a specific channel
  - Generates transcriptions with speaker identification and timestamps
  - Creates an Airtable record with the transcript, AI-generated summary, and title
  - Provides a link to the Airtable record
  - Includes error handling with a humorous limerick response for non-audio files
  - Shared screenshots demonstrating the bot's functionality
  - Announced plans to work on "link scraper/report/news bots" the following week

- User U06FQ785210 added the "bok-summer-25-report-bots" integration to the channel

### Web Development with Airtable Integration

- User U02KRAN4ZDL demonstrated Airtable-to-web integration:
  - Created a Next.js site pulling data from a health systems Airtable
  - Shared a screenshot showing the resulting web interface

### Channel Growth

- User U08TJSWSRSP joined the channel

The day demonstrated effective knowledge sharing and documentation, successful implementation of the media processing workflow, and progress on bot development and web integration - all key components of the reporting infrastructure being developed.
