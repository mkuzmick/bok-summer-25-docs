# Wednesday May 28

## Basic Summary of the Day

Wednesday's activities centered around technical development, physical infrastructure work, and project documentation. User U05635GR4BB shared a significant technical achievement, converting a course "personality quiz" from Streamlit to Flask and successfully deploying it on Railway with Canvas integration. Physical infrastructure work continued with User U02KRAN4ZDL reporting on cardboard compacting, while multiple team members shared visual documentation of various aspects of the project. User U0HTZUUP4 outlined a to-do list covering diverse topics including bots, AI ethics, and specific project components. The day demonstrated progress in both technical implementation and physical space organization, with continued emphasis on documentation through images.

## And Now All the Details

### Technical Development and Integration

- User U05635GR4BB completed a significant technical migration and deployment:
  - Converted a course "personality quiz" from Streamlit to Flask
  - The quiz was designed to identify student learning objective preferences based on a case study
  - Previously deployed locally, now hosted on Railway
  - Successfully embedded the application in Canvas for seamless student interaction
  - Implemented without requiring students to leave the Canvas environment
  - Added capability for easier data collection by instructors
  - Shared two images documenting the implementation
  - Described both the input (JSON file with scripted inputs) and output (hosted web application) aspects of the project

### Physical Infrastructure and Documentation

- User U02KRAN4ZDL reported: "cardboard........ compacted :boom::package:"
  - Indicates progress on physical infrastructure organization

- Multiple team members shared visual documentation:
  - User U0HTZUUP4 shared a screenshot, noting they were "deleting the video footage of this from yesterday"
  - User U7NPMMT6Z shared two JPEG images (IMG_1058.jpg and IMG_1061.jpg)
  - User U06FQ785210 shared two JPEG images (IMG_1846.jpg and IMG_1852.jpg)

### Project Planning and Management

- User U0HTZUUP4 shared a to-do list covering diverse topics:
  - "mk to do: jj story, bots, rosie, roomba, french antihumanism, ethics of AI"
  - The list suggests ongoing work on both technical components (bots) and conceptual/theoretical aspects (ethics of AI)

### Team Growth

- User U07ENH7BNF9 joined the channel

The day showed continued progress across multiple project dimensions, with particular emphasis on technical implementation, Canvas integration, and physical infrastructure organization. The successful deployment of the course quiz application on Railway with Canvas integration represents a significant technical achievement, providing a model for future educational tool development and integration.
