# Tuesday May 20

## Basic Summary of the Day

The second day of the project saw significant focus on goal-setting and project scoping. Team members defined their personal objectives for the week, ranging from specific technical skills to broader project goals. User U1VSBE6CF articulated the overall project vision with an MVP (an Airtable base) and a moonshot goal (workflow for undergraduate reporting integrated with existing LLUF systems). Meanwhile, User U0HTZUUP4 outlined an extensive technical roadmap centered around creating reports for shorter time durations, inspired by the 2015 Learning Lab Summer Report. This plan encompassed multiple technical initiatives including custom bot development, media workflows, and physical infrastructure enhancements to support reporting activities across the space.

## And Now All the Details

### Project Goals and Individual Objectives

- User U1VSBE6CF defined the project's core deliverables:
  - MVP: an Airtable base
  - Moonshot: a workflow for undergraduate reporting integrated with Jordan's current LLUF systems
  
- User U04Q49VR7UH outlined personal goals:
  - MVP: creating news and reports Slack bots
  - Moonshot: implementing everything in Codex and connecting bots to Airtable/link scraping
  
- User U04PRP4KK6C set technical skill objectives:
  - Learning Davinci Resolve interface basics
  - Developing skills for capturing and processing stills from recordings
  - Setting up studio infrastructure around Black Magic studio cameras
  
- User U02KRAN4ZDL identified key tools for the project:
  - Audio/video hardware (mics and cameras)
  - Whisper API for transcription
  - Airtable for data management
  - Next.js for development

### Comprehensive Technical Roadmap

- User U0HTZUUP4 detailed an extensive technical plan focused on reporting tools:
  - Reference to the 2015 Learning Lab Summer Report as a template
  - Initial use of TimelineJS with plans to develop better solutions
  - Integration with Airtable rather than Google Sheets for data management
  
- Specific workflow development priorities:
  1. Media processing workflows (pulling stills from Resolve with timecode preservation)
  2. Transcript processing using OpenAI 4o transcription tools
  3. Infrastructure improvements including ethernet cabling for reporting/podcasting zones
  4. Audio enhancements with shock mounts and hanging microphones
  
- Bot development roadmap including:
  - Enhanced image-to-markdown tools with AI integration
  - Updates/reporting bots with narrative parsing capabilities
  - Translation tools with reporting focus
  - Live logging and transcription tools
  - Task management bot improvements
  - Enhanced documentation tools for markdown/HackMD integration
  - PDF generation tools via headless browsers
  - Personal knowledge base tools for Slack
  - Media animation tools (Muybridge/Zoetrope bots)
  - News/research bots
  
- Multiple report delivery methods:
  1. Traditional paper delivery
  2. Chalkboard wall projections with audio augmentation
  3. Digital/web delivery

### Channel Growth
- New members joined the channel (Users U082EG1KEJY and U010KRJPM08)
- User U0HTZUUP4 mentioned plans for custom emoji bots for image ranking and manipulation

The day's discussions established a solid foundation for the week's work, with clear individual and collective goals, and a comprehensive technical roadmap to guide development efforts.
