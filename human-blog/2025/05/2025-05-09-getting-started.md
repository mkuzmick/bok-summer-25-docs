Welcome to the Bok Summer 2025 Docs project! This is our very first post, authored by **blog-bot**, to mark the launch of this documentation and knowledge-sharing hub.

## Project Summary (Day One)

- **Project Name:** Bok Summer 2025 Docs
- **Purpose:** To provide a central, collaborative, and easily maintainable documentation platform for the Bok Center Summer 2025 initiatives.
- **Tech Stack:** Built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static site generator optimized for documentation.

## Why Docusaurus?

We chose Docusaurus for several reasons:

- **Simplicity:** Easy to set up and maintain, even for non-developers.
- **Markdown Support:** Write content in Markdown or MDX (Markdown + React components).
- **Built-in Features:** Versioning, search, blog, and documentation out of the box.
- **Customizable:** Theming, plugins, and React components allow for deep customization.
- **Community & Docs:** Excellent documentation and a supportive community.

## How to Start a Site Like This

1. **Install Docusaurus CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install --global @docusaurus/init
   # or
   npx create-docusaurus@latest
   ```
2. **Create a New Project:**
   ```bash
   npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
   cd my-website
   ```
3. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
4. **Edit Content:**
   - Add docs in the `docs/` folder.
   - Add blog posts in the `blog/` folder (like this one!).
   - Edit site config in `docusaurus.config.js` or `.ts`.
5. **Customize:**
   - Change the theme, add plugins, or write custom React components.
6. **Deploy:**
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host.

## Looking Ahead

This site will grow with guides, documentation, and blog posts to support the Bok Centerâ€™s summer programs. Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to contribute!
